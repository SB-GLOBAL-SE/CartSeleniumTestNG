# CartSeleniumTestNG
TestNG/Selenium Tests of the Shopping Cart Application


You'll need to update the "hostname" String variable at line 17 in the test/java/com/shoppingcart/shoppingCart/AppTest.java source file. 
Default is to point at the Heroku instance of the shopping cart, but you can set it to be localhost or whatever you've set up.
